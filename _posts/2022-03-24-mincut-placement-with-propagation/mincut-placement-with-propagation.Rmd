# Mincut placement
- Repeatedly split the circuit into sub-circuits by [[Partitioning]] algorithm.
- Until each partition only occupied by a single gates (or sometimes special sub-circuits).

# Terminal propagation
- During the first partition, there are some cases that two gate $x$ and $y$ is in the adjacent block.(wire length = 1)
- But at the second partition, we tried to partition the block of $x$ and make $x$ away from $y$ (wire length = 2)
- We need to connect the $x$ and $y$ to prevent the additional wire length.

	- $m$ and $i$ should be in the same partition and at the left most side, otherwise we need more wire length.
