```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

- For function $h$
- Good at find a global optimum by jumping out of local optimum

# Idea
- Higher temperature will have higher momentum
- Lower temperature will have lower momentum and lower potential energy
- You will jump with big gap at high temperature and little gap at low temperature

# Algorithm (Find the maximum)
- $x$ is start point
- $T_1$ is start temperature
- For $i$ in 1 to N (Number of iteration) or $T_{max}$ to $T_{min}$
	- Sample a $\xi$ from normal distribution or other distribution
	- The proposal solution is $x' = x \pm \xi$
	- Decide that whether we accept the proposal
		- $\Delta h = h(x') - h(x)$
		- if the delta value is positive for maximize
			- accept the good change
		- Try to accept the bad change ( $\Delta h < 0$ )
			- Calculate probability $p = exp(\Delta h / T_i)$
				- $p$ is high when $T$ is high
				- bad $\Delta h$ (very negative) will have low $p$
			- If $p > rand(0,1)$
				- accept, $x = x'$
			- else $x = x$
	- Update the $T$ with your own method
		- $T$ - -
		- $T = \alpha T, 0 < \alpha < 1$
