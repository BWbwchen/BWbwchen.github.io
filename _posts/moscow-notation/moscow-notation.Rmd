## Motivation
During the internship at Logitech, I refactor and optimize the internal test tool. When I finished the coding, my manager ask me to write a detailed document to record the core logic in this test tool.

When I wrote the document, my manager ask me to use **MOSCOW** notation to list down the requirements of this test tool.

But, What is **MOSCOW** notation ? ðŸ¤”

## Meaning
MoSCoW is an acronym derived from four letters of each prioritization : M for MUST HAVE, S for SHOULD HAVE, C for COULD HAVE and W for WON'T HAVE. It didn't have O, just for word pronounceable.

## Example
So when I write a test tool(prime detector) to detect prime number and composite number and we plan to detect floating point in the future, I will need to write the below requirement.

```
PRIMEDETECTOR-1: MUST detect the prime number.
PRIMEDETECTOR-2: MUST detect the composite number.
PRIMEDETECTOR-3: SHOULD detect the floating point.
```
