# Goal
- Balanced bipartition.
- divided the circuit into 2 equal-sized partitions.

# Re-construct the flow network
- Turn the original circuit into bi-directed graph

  - for each net $n$ (hyperedge)
    - add vertices into graph $G$
    - add two auxiliary nodes $n_1$ and $n_2$ into the graph $G$ with edge of capacity $0$
    - connect the vertices into $n_1$ and $n_2$ into all the vertices with edge of capacity $\infty$

# Iteratively call the maximum-flow algorithm
- Randomly select 2 vertices as $s$ and $t$ for maximum-flow algorithm.
- Found the augmenting path $AG$ (maybe multiple paths)
- There are some net $n$ in the $AG$ , check whether it will construct the balanced partition.
	- Yes
		- We found the partition with cut size equals to the maximum flow value.
	- No, We got a cut $C(X, X')$
		- if $|X|$ has less vertices, merge the random vertices in $X'$ into vertex $s$ , vice versa.
